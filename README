Thought it would be nice to have a sort of personal Rosetta Code of various
languages I work with/am interested in.  Project Euler gives a nice structure
to this.

If you're looking for performance oriented solutions this is the *wrong* place
to look.  The goal here is to have efficient solutions preferably done in
the most idiomatic way for a given language, where efficient is taken in the
sense of being efficient for human consumption.  As far as the maths go, this
means I won't bother to find a cleverer solution if a given one halts under
a minute.

If you can suggest a more idiomatic solution I would be glad to hear from you.
Especially for Haskell and Scheme (and Clojure, I hope soon).  So feel free to
comment on the code, pull request, or whatever.  


Problem specific notes
------------------------

* Problem 5 does not need any programming, it's easily solvable with pen,
  paper, and a calculator.
